=============


Motif is a Java library that provides constructs to compose simple units of program logic, which together
forms the actual behavior in your application. Most of the concepts in Motif is inspired from
functional programming, but what's important is that it is just plain old Java, with no extra
bells and whistles, though it might look a little unfamiliar if you are mostly accustomed to
idiomatic Java code.





Composing motifs
=================

The name 'Motif' was inspired from music, where a motif is a recognizable and recurring small musical
fragment to form complete compositions from. Blahity blah blah blah blah. Blah.
